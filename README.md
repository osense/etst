## Erlang ternary search trees
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_search_tree
The tree is stored in a compressed form. Each node is made up of a binary character string, rather than a single character.

### Example tree
This tree is made up of the words: k1, k12, abc, abde, z, xa.
```
    k1
   / | \
  ab 2  z
   |   /
   c  xa 
    \
    de
```
